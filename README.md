# Movie-Review-Analytics-for-Crowdfunding
Crowdfunding is a practise of funding a project by raising small amounts from a large number of people which is usually via the internet. In order to get such required crowdfunding, communicating about the project with some facts about the success of the project is important. In our project we are focussing on analysing Big Data sets of movies which helps for crowdfunding of movies. Starting from collecting the raw data files for the movie and IMDB rating of each movie, we will be doing ‘Extraction Transformation and Loading’ using the AWS services. Final stage would be getting the data stored in the AWS into the Microsoft Power BI and showing the analysis visually. This will be helpful for the people who are interested in movie crowdfunding to make a decision about their investment keeping in mind the trend of previous movies.
